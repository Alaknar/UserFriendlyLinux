# User Friendly Linux
A while ago I was shouted at by a Linux user for saying that Windows is easier to operate. They said that "Linux is **much more user friendly than Windows**". I made [these notes](https://github.com/Alaknar/UserFriendlyLinux/blob/main/LinuxIsUserFriendly.md) for myself when trying to wrap my head around various Linux issues I stumbled upon, and named it as an homage to that user.
